# AirWatcher 
A government agency for environmental protection needs to monitor the air quality of a large
territory. The agency has installed a number of sensors for this purpose, which are spread evenly over
the territory. The sensors generate data at regular intervals. The data are gathered by the agency and
stored on a central server in a set of files in CSV format.

Here's how to build the executable and run the application:

1. Make sure you have the src directory and a makefile in it
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the makefile and the source files are located
3. Run the following command to build the executable: `make`. This command will compile all the necessary files and link them to create the `airwatcher`executable.
4. Now, you should see the `airwatcher` executable in the same directory (src)
5. You can now run the application by executing the following command in the terminal: `./airwatcher`. The application should start running.
6. To clean up the binaries and the executable, you can execute the following command: `make clean`.

That's it! Now you know how to build the executable! Enjoy using the application AirWatcher!
